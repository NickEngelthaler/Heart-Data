# Heart-Data-Spyder/Anaconda
This is a 6 function project that aims to look at general heart health data from the internet, and provide visualization as well as statistics on how certain values/subcategories perform.  The variables being looked at in this project are heart attack %, sex, chestpain as a scale of 1-4 corresponding to different levels of pain, bloodsugar, resting EKG rate, and whether or not the subject exercises.  The output of each function produces a graphical representation of the data after each calculation, as well a print statement.  The final result is a utilities file, as well as a csv containing the data and a main.py file to showcase the modular programming.

# Getting Started
Download the utilities.py file and main.py, as well as the heart.csv file.  Make sure they are all in the same directory, like a file on your desktop or both in downloads.

# Prerequisites
I used Python 3.9 for this project, on the latest version of spyder in the anaconda navigator at the time.  For optimal evaluation, please use something that showcases the data visualization aspects of this project like jupityer notebook and or spyder in anaconda.

# Running the tests
To evaluate the code, open the utilities.py file, and find the function you want to look at.  In every function, the top half is the actual calculations being done with NumPy, and the lower half is matplotlib being used to create the charts.  All of these functions are imported into the main.py file to showcase modular programming.

# Closing statement
Thank you to whoever reads this and takes the time to evaluate my code.  This is my second big project on my account here.  I hope to complete another one of the same style using linear regression on data sometime soon!
